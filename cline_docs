# Differences in Functionality between `page.tsx` and `page2.tsx`

## 1. Imports
- `page2.tsx` imports additional services: `lawncareServices`, `pressureWashingServices`, `dumpRunServices`, and `gardeningServices`.
- `page.tsx` imports `exteriorServices` and `interiorServices`.

## 2. State Management
- `page2.tsx` manages state for multiple categories and frequencies:
  - `lawncareServicesState`, `pressureWashingServicesState`, `dumpRunServicesState`, `gardeningServicesState`
  - `selectedPackages`, `activeCategory`, `selectedFrequency`
- `page.tsx` manages state for vehicle size and selected services:
  - `vehicleSize`, `selectedServices`

## 3. Service Selection Logic
- `page2.tsx` includes logic for toggling services and packages, and handles frequency changes.
- `page.tsx` includes logic for toggling services based on vehicle size.

## 4. Form Submission
- `page2.tsx` includes additional data in the form submission:
  - `category`, `frequency`, `packages`
- `page.tsx` includes data related to vehicle size and selected services.

## 5. UI Components
- `page2.tsx` includes UI components for selecting categories and frequencies.
- `page.tsx` includes UI components for selecting vehicle size.

## 6. Discount Combos

## 7. Calendar and Date Selection
- Both files include a calendar component for date selection.

## 8. Email Notifications

## Summary
